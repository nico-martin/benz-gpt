# BenzGPT
BenzGPT is am AI Agent that uses the [PromptAPI](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api) to understand a given command and then decide what it should do next. Should it just chat? Or should it move?

More than that it also uses the WebSpeechAPI to transcribe spoken words into text and then uses the SpeechSynthesisAPI to speak back to the user. So you can actually talk to BenzGPT!

To round it all off, of course, it's not just a virtual conversation. A toy car can also be controlled via WebBluetooth.
